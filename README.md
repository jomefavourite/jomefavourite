## Hello 👋, I'm Jome Favourite

I know right! My name "Favourite" seems odd to call out but that's my name. You can also call me Favour but I prefer my original name.

I'm a Computer Science students based at Nigeria, interested with Web Technologies.
I write to share the little I think I know or have been thought @hashnode.

I'm currently:

- Improving my skills by learning Javascript.
- Improving my social skills because I'm an introvert.
- Working on learning Tailwindcss.
- Participating on `#100DaysOfCode` Challenge (Follow me on Twitter to see my journey)

Fun/weird fact about me:

- I love music, currently listening to Faouzia.
- I love watching movies and series (some might say I over watch series 😬)
- I play games when bored (Call of Duty 🦸‍♂️)

Checkout my blog, to see what I'm up to:
