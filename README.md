# Hello üëã, I'm Favourite Jome

<!-- ![gif](https://jomefavourite.github.io/Images/gif.gif) -->

I know right! My name "Favourite" seems odd to call out but that's my name. You can also call me Favour but I prefer my original name.

I'm a Computer Science student based at Nigeria, interested with Web Technologies.
I write to share the little I think I know or have been taught @hashnode.

I'm currently:

- Improving my skills by learning Javascript.
- Learning React.
- Learning Node.js

Fun/weird fact about me:

- I love watching movies and series (some might say I over watch series üò¨)
- I play games when bored (Call of Duty ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)
