I know right! Favourite seems odd when people call my name but that's my name. You can also call me Favour but I prefer my original name.

I'm a Computer Science students based at Nigeria, interested with Web Technologies.
I write to share the little I think I know or have been thought.

I'm currently:

- Improving my skills by learning Javascript.

- Improving my social skills because I'm an extrovert.

- Working on learning Tailwindcss.

- Participating on `#100DaysOfCode` Challenge (Follow me on Twitter to see my journey)

Fun/weird fact about me:

- I love music, currently listening to Faouzia.

- I love watching movies and series (some might say I over watch series üò¨)

- I play games when bored (Call of Duty ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

Checkout my blog, to see what I'm up to:
